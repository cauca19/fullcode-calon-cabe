In this PHP code, we have a game called "Big Fish Eat Small Fish." The game involves a player controlling a big fish and deciding whether to eat a small fish that appears. The player's score increases if they successfully eat the small fish, and the game continues until the player is eaten by a bigger fish or chooses to let a small fish escape.

The game keeps track of the player's score and the highest score achieved. The highest score is stored in a text file called "highest_score.txt." If the player beats the highest score, it is updated, and a message is displayed.

To start the game, simply call the startGame() function.
